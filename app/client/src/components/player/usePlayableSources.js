 * A browser without an AV1 decoder in hardware falls back to software, which cannot
 * keep up: the audio plays on while the picture freezes, then skips ahead out of sync.
 * Nothing buffers, so the stall-based downgrade never sees it.
 *

 * is power efficient, and the source is kept, exactly as before.
